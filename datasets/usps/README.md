Dataset analysis
=================
The task of classifying the handwritten digits 0 to 4 against 5 to 9 of the USPS database. There is no actual source explained, but Dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bistaumanga/usps-dataset).

The dataset has 7291 train and 2007 test images. The images are 16*16 grayscale pixels.

So there are multiple flaws in the report reducing the ability to reproduce the experimental results.
